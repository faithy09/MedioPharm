# MedioPharm

# PROJECT OVERVIEW
MedioPharm Medical Center is a leading private healthcare institution based in Europe. Established over two decades ago, thehospital has grown from a local general practice facility into a multi-specialty medical center with departments spanning Cardiology,Pulmonology, Emergency Services, and Internal Medicine. With a patient-first philosophy and investments in advanced diagnostictools and treatment protocols, MedioPharm Medical Center has earned a reputation for clinical excellence and compassionate care.

# PROJECT OBJECTIVES
Develop SQL queries-To extract insights directly from raw EHR and operational datasets.
Enable identification-Of patients with abnormal vitals using recent monitoring data.
Analyze trends-In readmissions and attribute them to specific departments or conditions.
Evaluate staff responsiveness-By calculating doctor response times.
Aggregate department-level metrics For workload, outcome, and care effectiveness analysis.

# PROJECT RATIONALE:
Reduce ER Overload
Cut Readmission Rates
Improve Staff Utilization
Boost Departmental Effiency
Enable Proactive Risk Management

# PROBLEM
Emergency Room load
Readmission Trends
Staff Responsiveness
Effective of Patient care by Department
Risk Factors based on vitals.

**PROBLEM 1 :Workload & Capacity**
Admissions fluctuate across departments month‑to‑month, signaling uneven patient load distribution.
Peak doctor visit hours indicate staffing misalignment during high‑demand periods.

Solution:
• Implement dynamic staff scheduling based on hourly visit patterns.
• Redistribute workload between departments showing under‑utilization.

Operational Measures:
• Introduce a real‑time admissions dashboard.
• Enforce workload balancing protocols during peak periods.

# TECH STACK TOOLS- SQL SERVER, POWERBI

# DATA
The data for MedioPharm Medical Centre shows the overall admissions (4,013) of patient and 1008 cases of emergency. A total number of doctors (9014) and (3000) number of patients. Analysis shows the four (4) department (Pulmonology, Cardiology, Internal Medicine, Emergency) that the patients also visited. 
The Pulmonology department had the highest number of doctors that consult with patients.The medical centre had more male (51%) being treated as emergency cases than female which had (49%).
The total number of patient who recovered is 2,802, 626 patient in ICU, 372 patients were readmitted and 213 deceased cases.


# RECOMMENDATION
Mediopharm should adopt an integrated hospital performance framework combining:
• Real‑time monitoring (vitals, workload, responsiveness).
• Predictive risk analytics.
• Department‑specific quality improvement cycles.
 
These actions will produce smoother operations, reduced risk, and measurably improved patient outcomes.
