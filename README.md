# PROJECT OVERVIEW
MedioPharm Medical Center is a leading private healthcare institution based in Europe. Established over two decades ago, thehospital has grown from a local general practice facility into a multi-specialty medical center with departments spanning Cardiology,Pulmonology, Emergency Services, and Internal Medicine. With a patient-first philosophy and investments in advanced diagnostictools and treatment protocols, MedioPharm Medical Center has earned a reputation for clinical excellence and compassionate care.

# PROJECT OBJECTIVES
Develop SQL queries-To extract insights directly from raw EHR and operational datasets.
Enable identification-Of patients with abnormal vitals using recent monitoring data.
Analyze trends-In readmissions and attribute them to specific departments or conditions.
Evaluate staff responsiveness-By calculating doctor response times.
Aggregate department-level metrics For workload, outcome, and care effectiveness analysis.

# PROJECT RATIONALE:
Reduce ER Overload
Cut Readmission Rates
Improve Staff Utilization
Boost Departmental Effiency
Enable Proactive Risk Management

# PROBLEM
Emergency Room load
Readmission Trends
Staff Responsiveness
Effective of Patient care by Department
Risk Factors based on vitals.

**PROBLEM 1 :Workload & Capacity**
Admissions fluctuate across departments month‑to‑month, signaling uneven patient load distribution.
Peak doctor visit hours indicate staffing misalignment during high‑demand periods.

Solution:
• Implement dynamic staff scheduling based on hourly visit patterns.
• Redistribute workload between departments showing under‑utilization.

Operational Measures:
• Introduce a real‑time admissions dashboard.
• Enforce workload balancing protocols during peak periods.

# TECH STACK TOOLS- SQL SERVER, POWERBI

# DATA

# RECOMMENDATION
Mediopharm should adopt an integrated hospital performance framework combining:
• Real‑time monitoring (vitals, workload, responsiveness).
• Predictive risk analytics.
• Department‑specific quality improvement cycles.
 
These actions will produce smoother operations, reduced risk, and measurably improved patient outcomes.
